# Simple Snake Game

A predecessor to the [Snake Final Project](https://github.com/dhasl002/Teaching-SnakeProject), this is a replication of the classic game snake. In this game the player attempts to control the snake, eating food to get longer. As the snake continues to grow, it becomes more difficult to not hit any obstacles. This was an assignment created for CS250 at Old Dominion University. Due to the course restrictions, the game is played on the command line. This contributes to a very ugly interface.
